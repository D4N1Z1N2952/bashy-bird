# bashy-bird
A project that I made to study bash. It is basicly flappy bird in bash. It is still needing some changes but this is the 1.0 version
# how to use
just go into the terminal change to the directory that the file .sh is located with:
```
cd target_directory
```
and then execute with:
```
bash bashy_bird.sh
```
or:
```
chmod +x bashy_bird.sh
./bashy_bird.sh
```
